I agreed reluctantly.    Finally, the Christmas Eve had come, I decorated a Christmas tree with stars and lights, I had placed  some milk and cookies for Banta to have, and wrote a small note of what I wanted as a gift from  Banta! I placed the note inside a small sock and hanged the sock to the Christmas tree. Just like it  was all shown in the children’s books which I used to read, and I went to sleep.    On that night my mom had placed the gift which she had purchased earlier, along with the note in  the wooden box in my room without me knowing because she did not want to see me disappointed.  As children everyone has a wide imaginations. The parent’s duty is make their wishes come true  even if it seems very silly. Because that is what makes them chase after their dreams when they  grow up.', 'Speech3: The day I got a gift from Banta Claws!        I still remember that day when I was just 10 year old child, I woke up early in the morning the day  after Christmas Eve. I immediately rushed towards the corner of the room where I had placed a  wooden box. I opened the box, inside it was a gift from Banta Claws!    I jumped with joy by just by the sight of it. Finally my wish came true. Along with the gift there was  also a note which read “Karthik, my elves told me you were a good boy this year, here is a gift for  you. Merry Christmas! – Banta”. I ran to the kitchen holding the gift, “Amma! Amma! See I told you  Banta was real! Look I got a gift from him!” Such a wonderful feeling it was.    I always wanted a gift from Banta, I had read a lot of stories about Banta Claws in children’s book  and in movies. He had a workshop in North Pole where Banta and his millions of elves made toys  throughout the year. When it was time for Christmas Banta used to bring all the toys for the children  in a sleigh pulled by reindeers through the night sky. When everyone is sleeping, Banta comes into  the house through the “chimney”, places the gifts next to the Christmas tree and vanishes. In olden  days all houses used to have chimneys in western countries where people used to light fire to keep  themselves warm in winter.     As a small child I believed all these stories were true. And I thought since we never decorated a  Christmas tree earlier, I never got a gift from Banta. So, I decided I will place a Christmas tree this  year so I even I could get a gift from Banta.
